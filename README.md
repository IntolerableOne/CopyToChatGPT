Credits go to OpenAI.  I don't know Pythong.

1.  Select a project/target folder.  
2.  Select relevant files from within that folder or subfolders.
3.  Hit the 'Copy Files to Clipboard' button.
4.  Paste contents into ChatGPT, with all files merged with filename and extension inserted above each files section of code.

Additionally you can quickly copy the folder structure similar to 'Tree /F src\' by hitting the 'Copy Folder Structure to Clipboard' to provide ChatGPT even more context.

Oh and it'll give you a vaguely accurate idea on the number of Token's used when pasting the clipboard contents as a prompt.  With some little quality of life stuff like select all, deselect all, refresh files in directory and it'll save your last known directory.  Did I mention I don't know Python?
